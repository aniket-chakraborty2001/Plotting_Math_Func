# Project On Plotting_Mathemetical_Functions

### Small Introduction:
This is Aniket Chakraborty. I came from Mathematics Background. From class 10, 11 and 12 i am seeing and working with differnet functions and suddenly one day, i came up with an idea about how the functions looks like in real life. I reached to my Mathematics Tracher and asks him for help me out in this situation. He told me to contact Computer teacher. Well time passes and when I came to college, I met with one of the the then faculty of Mathematics Department. On that time he tached us ipython. The whole idea came up from that point of view. From him i learnt:
* Ploting of Sine Function.
* Plotting of Cosine Function.
* Plotting of Tangent Function.
* Plotting of Logarithmic Function.
* Plotting of Exponential Function.

##### One backlog I faced then was my all work is based on the ipython module which deals with interactive plots. So for many years my focus shifts on the python and not only on any specific module.

### Aim of this project:
* This project will focus on how to make a clear and efficient to infer plots in python using different libraries such as Matplotlib, pyplot and Numpy. This project will help students to visualize the plots of famous Mathemetical functions.

* Not only this. In this project I will cover how to define a function and plot it by making a list of the functional values.
* Also taking input from users and making plot as their wish is also covered in this project.

### Here we will going to plot the basics Mathematical functions with the help of matplotlib and Numpy library.
The functions are-
* 1. Square function
* 2. Cube function
* 3. Plotting square function and cube function in a single plot
* 4. Square root function
* 5. Cube root function
* 6. Mod function
* 7. Trigonometric Sine function
* 8. Trigonometric Cosine function
* 9. Trigonometric Tangent Function
* 10. Plotting Sine and Cosine function in a single plot
* 11. Logarithmic function
* 12. Exponential function
* 13. Floor function
* 14. Celling function
* 15. Define and plot Signum function
* 16. Plotting of the function y=x^(1/2*n)
* 17. Plotting of the function y=(1/x)
* 18. Plotting of the function y=(1/x^(2*n-1))
* 19. Plottting of the function y=(1/x^(2*n))
* 20. Defining three function and plotting them
